# FPISIJ
Functional Programming In Scala In Javascript. Based on the book "Functional Programming in Scala". I'm solving the exercises in the book using JavaScript, and hopefully learning a few things along the way.

To use locally clone the repo and run the following in the same folder:
````
npm install
npm start
````
Then open the generated file "exercises.html". You will see Scala and JavaScript solutions side by side, and all the tests results at the end of the page.
